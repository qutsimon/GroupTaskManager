    - tasks completed after generation should should feed automatically into the constructed group
- tasks filters (user, etc)
- comments on tasks
- add UI explanations to the mockups
- group "Things to consider" in the mock ups in a future implementations document
- Refactor github directories, maybe keep design documents in a seperate branch
